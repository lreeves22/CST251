    <h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
    <p>The Idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my
      computer and add index.html files.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had problems with uploading the picture into atom. I wasn't sure how I
      was even supposed to link it. But my partner helped me figure it out.
    Just had to get the link from the browser.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>This is the file structure I made. I am proud of working through all <thead>
      steps and making this!
