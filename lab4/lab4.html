    <h1>Lab 4 File Transfer</h1>
    <p>Testing local files and then uploading them to a server</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had some struggles with figuring out how to link everything and kind of
    what the lab was. But I figured it out.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>My results were that I linked my labs to the lab list on the bottom
    of my main page. I also uploaded my site with having it work properly.
