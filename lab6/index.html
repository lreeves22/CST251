			<h2>Big Idea</h2>
		<p>Working with a partner, test your files locally and then
			upload them to the server.</p>
			<h3>Difficulties</h3>

				of them. I'm not too sure where in the process I
				scrambled them up.</p>
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>I was able to get to css to link and now I have a
