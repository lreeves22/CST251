    <h1>Lab 8 CSS Selectors </h1>
    <p>We will be experimenting with CSS selectors in this lab. </p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I had challeneges with linking certain properties into my page.
    I wasn't sure how the colors and fonts worked on how to add them in. </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p> I was able to put a border around my page which was cool. I'm not sure
      why my background color didn't work. Overall not a good experince could
      be needing some help soon.
